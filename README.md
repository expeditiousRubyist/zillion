# Zillion
Simple command line utility to generate English language names for a number of arbitrary size. Uses the Conway-Weschler system of naming to produce a valid name for any number of digits.

Input should be a sequence of only digits, supplied via command line arguments. Alternatively, the program may be run with no arguments, with inputs supplied via stdin.
